# Drake RCC-4 Calibrator, Modern Remake

Based on the schematic from the R-4C manual.

Notes:

1. Make sure to use a SN7473N. Do not use a 74LS73 or other substitutes. Get the 7473 from eBay or another place that specializes in old ICs.
2. The 100 KHz crystal is a tall vintage crystal. Ebay is your source.
3. The old transistors ... eBay again.
4. For the "pins" that will go into the socket, use 12GA bare copper wire, from your local hardware store. A nice upgrade would be to use plated buss wire, at the cost of $$$.
5. The variable cap can be found in an assortment of caps from eBay or Amazon
